The file RunOnArduinoEtchASketch_Joystick.ino is trying to generate the feature of an etch to sketch using 2 joysticks.  I am completing a prototype for an assignment at school and found out that these two assignments are similar.
The extraction is in process but is considering all possible sequence and return either we are turning clockwise or counter clockwise foreach joystick.
I am creating a processing sketch that will receive that data.
